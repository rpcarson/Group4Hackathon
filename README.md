# Group4Hackathon


This is the group project I worked as the iOS developer on along with teammate Shannon. We worked with both front end and backend developers and won second place out of 6 in the hackathon.

The concept was create a game similar to angry birds in which blocks are knocked over. There is a total budget and each projectile represents a consultant thrown at the project. Object is to "complete" the project (by blowing up a computer) under budget.
